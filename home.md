Welcome to Elements of Mathematics! I try to learn the core areas
of modern mathematics exhaustively; then I try to digest that 
knowledge by posting here. 

Elements of Mathematics is also available under the alternative domain
[https://math.ac.nz](https://math.ac.nz). There is no comment section
as the posts are mostly notes to myself but you are more than welcome
to use my email address for pointing out mathematical errors.

I love telling stories through mathematics and mathematical proofs
provide a wonderful opportunity to tell exciting stories.

I am mostly interested in algebraic geometry and related areas but also
enjoy mathematics outside algebraic geometry that connects various
parts of mathematics together.
